# RatDetector üêÄ

### Overview
**RatDetector** is a machine learning-based project designed to identify and detect rat presence using image recognition techniques. This project leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify images and detect rats in urban settings. The goal is to provide an efficient solution for monitoring rodent populations.

### Features
- **Real-time detection:** The model can be deployed for live rat detection.
- **High accuracy:** Achieves over 90% accuracy in identifying rats from non-rat images.
- **Scalability:** Can be adapted to work with other types of image-based object detection tasks.
- **Data augmentation:** Utilizes techniques like rotation and flipping to improve model robustness.

---

### Tech Stack
- **Python 3.8**
- **TensorFlow 2.4**: For building and training the CNN model.
- **OpenCV**: For image preprocessing and handling video streams.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing model performance.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For development and experimentation.

### Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RatDetector.git
    cd RatDetector
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use: .\env\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download or prepare the dataset. You can use the dataset provided in the repository or collect images of rats/non-rats.

### Usage

To run the model on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Preprocess the dataset:**
   Use the `preprocess_data.py` script to clean and prepare the dataset:
   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py --input <data_directory> --output <processed_data_directory>

2. **Train the Model:** Train the CNN using the training script:
   python train_model.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 32 --data_dir <processed_data_directory>

3. **Test the Model:** After training, you can test the model on new images:
   python test_model.py --image <path_to_image>

4. **Deploy for real-time detection:** You can run a live detection demo using a webcam or video feed:
   python live_detection.py
